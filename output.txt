I have completed and committed the implemented tasks for Phase 2 (Module 1 content and interactive components).

The following tasks are still marked as **in-progress** and require your input:

*   **T020: Record and edit a video tutorial: "Building a Robot in URDF" (10 min).**
*   **T022: Create 10 practice exercises with solutions for the ROS 2 module.**

Please let me know if these tasks are now complete. If not, would you like me to proceed with the tasks in **Phase 3: Module 2 - The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)**, or would you prefer to complete the pending tasks first?
