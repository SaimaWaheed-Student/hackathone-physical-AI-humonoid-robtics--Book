I have completed and committed tasks T037 and T038, which involved creating placeholder scripts for loading humanoid models and domain randomization in Isaac Sim.

The next task is **T039: Generate dataset: 5000 annotated images.** This task requires your intervention to execute the domain randomization script within Isaac Sim and generate the synthetic dataset.

I have marked T039 as "in-progress" in the `tasks.md` file and provided detailed instructions. Once you have generated this dataset, please let me know, and I will mark T039 as complete and proceed with the next task.
