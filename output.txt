I am unable to understand the request "ab iskp implement bhi tu karo" as "iskp" is not a recognizable term or task ID from our plan.

I have completed all tasks that I can directly implement or provide detailed instructions for. The project is currently awaiting your input for the content creation and external deployment tasks that are marked as "in-progress" in `tasks.md`.

To proceed, please:

1.  **Specify which task you are referring to** from the `tasks.md` file (e.g., "T020 is complete" or "Implement T022").
2.  If you would like me to work on a new task, please **provide clear and specific instructions** in English.

I am awaiting your clear and actionable instructions.
