I have completed and committed tasks T027-T029, which involved adding simulated sensors to the humanoid URDF.

The next task is **T030: Record and edit a video tutorial: "Tuning Physics Parameters in Gazebo" (8 min).** This task requires your intervention to create the video content.

I have marked T030 as "in-progress" in the `tasks.md` file and provided detailed instructions. Once you have created and placed the video in the specified directory, please let me know, and I will mark T030 as complete and proceed with embedding it in the relevant lesson.
