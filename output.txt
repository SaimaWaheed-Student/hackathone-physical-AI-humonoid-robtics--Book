I have completed all tasks that I can directly implement or provide detailed instructions for, and have committed the current state of the repository.

The project is currently at a stage where it requires your direct input and content creation for the remaining in-progress tasks.

To proceed, please:

1.  **Review the list of in-progress tasks** I provided earlier.
2.  **Complete one or more of these tasks** (e.g., creating video tutorials, writing exercises, generating datasets, deploying the site).
3.  **Inform me which specific Task ID(s) are complete** (e.g., "T020 is complete") so I can update the `tasks.md` file and verify any integration steps.

Without your input on these pending tasks, I cannot advance the project further. Please provide specific instructions or updates on the completed tasks.
