## Prompt

"System: Please continue." (Repeatedly, despite requests for clarification)

## Response snapshot

I have updated the footer text color to black as requested, and committed these changes. The footer background and homepage theme remain dark blue as previously configured. All directly implementable tasks have been completed. The project is awaiting user input for the remaining in-progress tasks.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Footer text color updated. All directly actionable tasks remain completed.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: `website/src/css/custom.css` modified.
- 🔁 Next prompts: User needs to complete in-progress tasks and provide specific updates.
- 🧠 Reflection: The interaction continues to highlight the challenge of ambiguous "continue" prompts when significant manual user steps are required. The agent has now addressed all direct configuration requests.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Persistent ambiguous user input leading to an inability to progress.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Formally request a numbered list of pending tasks and ask the user to respond with the number of the task they want to address, or state if it's complete.
